The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 39.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 59.7 hours of data, or 36.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (19,23.6,56)
