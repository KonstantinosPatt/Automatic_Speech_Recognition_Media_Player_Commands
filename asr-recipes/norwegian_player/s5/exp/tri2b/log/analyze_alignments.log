The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 36.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 65.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 67.9 hours of data, or 42.9 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,16.0,44)
