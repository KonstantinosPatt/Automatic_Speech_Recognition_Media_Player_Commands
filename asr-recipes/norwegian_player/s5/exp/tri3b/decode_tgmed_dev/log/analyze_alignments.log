The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 35.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 67.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 28.1 hours of data, or 18.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,14.8,42)
