The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 20.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 95.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 17.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.3 hours of data, or 4.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (31,39.2,108)
