The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 95.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 18.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.3 hours of data, or 4.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (36,43.2,113)
