1088-134315-0023 CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
1088-134315-0024 THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1088-134315-0026 MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
1088-134315-0027 THIS INTERESTED HIM MIGHTILY AND HE REPLACED THE CHEQUE BOOK WITH THE TIGHTENED LIPS AND THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN WHO WAS THINKING RAPIDLY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE SECRETARY WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING COPIES OF KARA'S CORRESPONDENCE
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST

1088-134315-0030 RUM COVE SAID FISHER HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BEFORE THE CLOSED DOOR OF THE ROOM AND SMILINGLY SURVEYED THE GREAT STEEL LATCH WHICH SPANNED THE DOOR AND FITTED INTO AN IRON SOCKET SECURELY SCREWED TO THE FRAMEWORK HE LIFTED IT GINGERLY
1088-134315-0031 THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOB FOR THE PURPOSE AND LET IT FALL GENTLY INTO THE SOCKET WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO RECEIVE IT ON THE DOOR ITSELF RUM COVE HE SAID AGAIN AND LIFTING THE LATCH TO THE HOOK WHICH HELD IT UP LEFT THE ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
1088-134315-0032 HE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH A MEDITATIVE FROWN AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HALL HE WAS LESS THAN HALF WAY DOWN WHEN THE ONE MAID OF KARA'S HOUSEHOLD CAME UP TO MEET HIM THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS TO SEE MISTER KARA SHE SAID HERE IS HIS CARD
1088-134315-0033 FISHER TOOK THE CARD FROM THE SALVER AND READ MISTER GEORGE GATHERCOLE JUNIOR TRAVELLERS CLUB I'LL SEE THIS GENTLEMAN HE SAID WITH A SUDDEN BRISK INTEREST HE FOUND THE VISITOR STANDING IN THE HALL

1088-134315-0037 EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
1088-134315-0038 AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER

1088-134315-0055 IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134315-0057 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134315-0058 IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
1088-134318-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0001 IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
1088-134318-0002 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0003 TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0007 KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID

1088-134318-0009 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM

1088-134318-0013 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0016 NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID

1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
118-47824-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0003 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
118-47824-0006 PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN

118-47824-0008 DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
118-47824-0009 IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
118-47824-0010 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0011 GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED

118-47824-0014 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0015 THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
118-47824-0016 HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0018 HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
118-47824-0019 THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
118-47824-0020 OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
118-47824-0021 FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
118-47824-0022 YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
118-47824-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0024 LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
118-47824-0025 BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
118-47824-0026 PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
118-47824-0027 WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS
118-47824-0084 SCRATCHED AND WITH BROKEN HANDLES THE CLOSED COLONIAL DESK THE MISERLY RAG CARPET ALL SEEMED MUTELY ASKING AS BOBBY DID
118-47824-0085 FROM THE CHEST OF DRAWERS TWO CANDLES THE ONLY LIGHT
118-47824-0086 SO FOR THE SECOND TIME THE LIVING MET THE DEAD AND THE LAW WATCHED HOPEFULLY
163-122947-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
163-122947-0001 OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
163-122947-0002 AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
163-122947-0003 WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
163-122947-0004 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0005 IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
163-122947-0006 NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
163-122947-0007 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0009 INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
163-122947-0010 IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
163-122947-0011 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0012 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0013 LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
163-122947-0014 FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
163-122947-0015 JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0016 I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
163-122947-0017 SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
163-122947-0018 TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0021 I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
163-122947-0022 IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
163-122947-0023 GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
163-122947-0024 AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
163-122947-0025 THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0027 WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
163-122947-0028 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0030 THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
163-122947-0031 AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
163-122947-0032 SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0033 BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
163-122947-0034 MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
163-122947-0035 THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
163-122947-0036 DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
163-122947-0037 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0039 THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0042 AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
163-122947-0043 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0045 WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
163-122947-0046 AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0048 THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
163-122947-0049 THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
163-122947-0050 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0051 AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
163-122947-0052 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0053 AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
163-122947-0054 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0055 WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
163-122947-0056 ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
163-122947-0057 A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
163-122947-0058 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0060 WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
163-122947-0061 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0063 IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0065 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0066 AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
163-122947-0067 OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0069 THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
163-122947-0070 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0072 AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
163-122947-0073 THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
163-122947-0074 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0076 APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
163-122947-0077 SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
163-122947-0078 AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
163-122947-0079 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0080 AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
163-122947-0081 PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0083 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0084 AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
163-122947-0085 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0086 THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED

163-122947-0088 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0089 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
163-122947-0090 BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS

163-122947-0094 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
