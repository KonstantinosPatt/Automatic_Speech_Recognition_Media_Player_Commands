7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
7976-110523-0000 HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US
7976-110523-0001 HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES
7976-110523-0002 OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US
7976-110523-0003 BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN
7976-110523-0004 AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT
7976-110523-0005 AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE
7976-110523-0006 BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH
7976-110523-0007 BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN
7976-110523-0008 EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE
7976-110523-0009 WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN
7976-110523-0010 HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY
7976-110523-0011 COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE
7976-110523-0012 THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY
7976-110523-0013 THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE
7976-110523-0014 GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED
7976-110523-0015 GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM
7976-110523-0016 DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED
7976-110523-0017 CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL
7976-110523-0018 SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF
7976-110523-0019 AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN
7976-110523-0020 AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES
7976-110523-0021 THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK
8297-275156-0000 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED
8297-275156-0001 YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE
8297-275156-0002 WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT
8297-275156-0003 NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY
8297-275156-0004 SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE
8297-275156-0005 IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD
8297-275156-0006 HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW
8297-275156-0007 EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM
8297-275156-0008 BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW
8297-275156-0009 CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND
8297-275156-0010 WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE
8297-275156-0011 SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW
8297-275156-0012 HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING
8297-275156-0013 BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY
84-121550-0000 BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES
84-121550-0001 ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL
84-121550-0002 THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING
84-121550-0003 I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM
84-121550-0004 YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST
84-121550-0005 SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT
84-121550-0006 THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE
84-121550-0007 BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY
84-121550-0008 THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE
84-121550-0009 BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED
84-121550-0010 NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN
84-121550-0011 NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK
84-121550-0012 THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES
84-121550-0013 AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE
84-121550-0014 THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART
84-121550-0015 THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG
84-121550-0016 NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE
84-121550-0017 THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED
84-121550-0018 THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN
84-121550-0019 IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE
84-121550-0020 AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED
84-121550-0021 AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER
84-121550-0022 AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH
84-121550-0023 TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED
84-121550-0024 TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME
84-121550-0025 DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP
84-121550-0026 I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER
84-121550-0027 LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE
84-121550-0028 YE KEEP YOUR WATCH IN THE ETERNAL DAY SO THAT NOR NIGHT NOR SLEEP CAN STEAL FROM YOU ONE STEP THE AGES MAKE UPON THEIR PATH
84-121550-0029 THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE
84-121550-0030 BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT
84-121550-0031 AS SOON AS EVER OF MY SECOND AGE I WAS UPON THE THRESHOLD AND CHANGED LIFE HIMSELF FROM ME HE TOOK AND GAVE TO OTHERS
84-121550-0032 SO LOW HE FELL THAT ALL APPLIANCES FOR HIS SALVATION WERE ALREADY SHORT SAVE SHOWING HIM THE PEOPLE OF PERDITION
84-121550-0033 CONFUSION AND DISMAY TOGETHER MINGLED FORCED SUCH A YES FROM OUT MY MOUTH THAT SIGHT WAS NEEDFUL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT
84-121550-0034 WHENCE SHE TO ME IN THOSE DESIRES OF MINE WHICH LED THEE TO THE LOVING OF THAT GOOD BEYOND WHICH THERE IS NOTHING TO ASPIRE TO
84-121550-0035 AND WHAT ALLUREMENTS OR WHAT VANTAGES UPON THE FOREHEAD OF THE OTHERS SHOWED THAT THOU SHOULDST TURN THY FOOTSTEPS UNTO THEM
8842-304647-0000 HE LIVES THY LOSS HE DIES FROM EVERY LIMB MANGLED BY THEE LIGHTNINGS OF GODHEAD SHINE FROM WHICH THY DARKNESS HATH NOT WHERE TO HIDE
8842-304647-0001 QUINCI IMPARA A STUPIRTI
8842-304647-0002 IN FLESH WAS RAIMENTED HOW HE WAS KILLED AND BURIED FROM THE DEAD HOW HE AROSE TO LIFE WITH VICTORY AND REIGNED IN HEAVEN HOW ALL OF US SHALL BE GLORIOUS LIKE HIM WHOSE HEARTS TO HIS ARE WED HOW THEY WHO DIE FOR LOVE OF REASON GIVE HYPOCRITES TYRANTS SOPHISTS ALL WHO SELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS ILL FOR HOLINESS TO HELL HOW THE DEAD SAINT CONDEMNS THE BAD WHO LIVE HOW ALL HE DOES BECOMES A LAW FOR MEN HOW HE AT LAST TO JUDGE SHALL COME AGAIN
8842-304647-0003 THIS WORLD'S THICK VAPOURS WHELM YOUR EYES UNWORTHY OF THAT GLORIOUS SHOW BLIND TO HIS SPLENDOUR BENT UPON HIS SHAME
8842-304647-0004 MONEY IS FALSE AND LIGHT UNLESS IT BE BOUGHT BY A MAN'S OWN WORTHY QUALITIES AND BLOOD IS SUCH THAT ITS CORRUPT DISEASE AND IGNORANT PRETENCE ARE FOUL TO SEE
8842-304647-0005 IL POPOLO E UNA BESTIA
8842-304647-0006 THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEARS VAIN
8842-304647-0007 MOST WONDERFUL
8842-304647-0008 THAT PENANCE HATH NO BLAME WHICH MAGDALEN FOUND SWEET PURGING OUR SHAME SELF PUNISHMENT IS VIRTUE ALL MEN KNOW
8842-304647-0009 ORGAN OF RUT NOT REASON IS THE LORD WHO FROM THE BODY POLITIC DOTH DRAIN LUST FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LEAN AS CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD
8842-304647-0010 WELL TOO IF HE LIKE LOVE WOULD FILCH OUR HOARD WITH PLEASURE TO OURSELVES SLUICING OUR VEIN AND VIGOUR TO PERPETUATE THE STRAIN OF LIFE BY SPILTH OF LIFE WITHIN US STORED
8842-304647-0011 HEAVEN HELP THAT BODY WHICH A LITTLE MIND HOUSED IN A HEAD LACKING EARS TONGUE AND EYES AND SENSELESS BUT FOR SMELL CAN TYRANNISE
8842-304647-0012 DUE TO THEE THEIR PRAISE OF MAIDEN PURE OF TEEMING MOTHERHOOD
8842-304647-0013 THOU LIKE ARCTURUS STEADFAST IN THE SKIES WITH TARDY SENSE GUIDEST THY KINGDOM FAIR BEARING ALONE THE LOAD OF LIBERTY
